Installing the theme can be done one of two ways: uploading the zip file via the admin or manually. In this guide, we will only cover uploading the zipf ile via the admin.

The `halsted-theme.zip` is the file that you will upload to the backend of your Ghost installation.

## Through Admin

From your Ghost instance admin, click on the Design page. From the Design page, click on "Upload a theme". You can either drag the `halsted-theme.zip` file to the "Upload a theme" popup box from where you downloaded it on your computer or you can click the box to select the file from where you downloaded it on your computer. Afterwards, the file will upload and the theme will be activated.
