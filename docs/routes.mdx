After you upload your theme, you will need to set the routes for your site. This step is necessary to set your Ghost instances up for member signup and subscription. The `routes.yml` file contains the routes and is included in your zip file.

From your admin, go to the Labs page. Under "Beta Features" is a "Routes" area. Click on "Upload routes YAML". Navigate to where the unzip theme files are on your computer and select `routes.yaml` file. When the upload is completed successfully, the "Upload routes YAML" button will turn green and say "Uploaded".
