The favicon of your site is generated using the Publication icon from your admin area. To upload your own favicon, go to the General page in your admin area. Find "Publication icon" and click "Upload Image". Find your favicon (be sure the image is at least 60px x 60px) and select it. When upload is completed successfully, the Upload image button will turn green and say "Uploaded".
